# PowerBox

If you’ve dabbled in astrophotography for more than five minutes, you’ve probably encountered The Great Cable Disaster™. Cables everywhere. Dangling. Tangling. Creating their own gravity wells.

Maybe you’ve had a meridian flip that turned into a full-blown rig flip (bonus points if something snapped in the process). Maybe a rogue cable decided to yoink your expensive camera’s USB connection straight to the afterlife. Or, if you’re extra lucky, a random neighborhood cat used your rig as a jungle gym, and all your night’s hard work turned into a gallery of not-so-artistic star trails.

Even when you think you’ve got cable management under control – spoiler alert – you don’t. Not for long, anyway.

So, like any good problem-solver (or desperate hobbyist on a budget), you go online. And what do you find? Power boxes! The magical fix! Only, oh wait… they cost a small fortune. Because of course they do.

That’s when I said, “Enough of this!” and decided to build my own. But not just any DIY power box – I wanted something better, smarter, and, most importantly, way cheaper.

And I did it. It’s beautiful. It’s powerful. It’s got more bells and whistles than a spaceship. Voltage readings? Check. Load monitoring? Check. Full control over each output? Oh yeah. The PowerBox isn’t just a power solution – it’s the power solution.
